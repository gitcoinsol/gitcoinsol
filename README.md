Gitcoinsol CA:

Since people go absolutely bonkers on any coin that has a GitHub link nowadays, I decided to make Gitcoinsol.

What Is Gitcoinsol?

Gitcoinsol is the next-gen, AI-powered, military-grade, SpaceX-level technology for people who like clicking “⭐ Star” before reading a single line of code.

⚙️ Features

✅ Integrated military-level SpaceX tek

🤖 AI-generated randomness for extra “utility”

🧠 Optimized for bullishness, not usefulness

💾 Includes GitHub link, therefore 100× more legitimate

🐂 Backed by nothing — but with confidence
<!--
*📡 Proof of Tek

Don’t believe me? Check out our GitHub — where the magic of randomness meets overconfidence.
